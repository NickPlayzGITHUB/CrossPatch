# Privacy Policy

CrossPatch is designed with user privacy in mind. This document explains what information the application handles and why.

## Data Collection and Usage

CrossPatch does **not** collect, store, or transmit any personal user data.

The application interacts with the following third-party services as part of its core functionality:

- **GameBanana API**: Used to browse, search for, and download mods. This involves sending requests to `gamebanana.com` to fetch mod listings and file information.
- **GitHub API**: Used to check for updates to the CrossPatch application itself. This involves sending a request to `api.github.com`.

All network communication with these services is performed over secure HTTPS connections. No user-identifying information is sent in these requests, other than what is standard for web traffic (e.g., IP address, User-Agent string).

## Local Data

CrossPatch stores configuration files locally on your computer. This includes:
- Your selected game and mods folder paths.
- A list of your installed mods and their enabled/disabled status.
- Window size and position.
- Mod profiles and their configurations.

This data is stored on your local machine and is never transmitted elsewhere.
